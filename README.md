Risk Reward Analysis 
Evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios.  The Risk Reward Analysis determines the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

Analyze the Performance
Analyze the data to determine if any of the portfolios outperform the broader stock market, which the S&P 500 represents.

Analyze the Volatility
Analyze the volatility of each of the four fund portfolios and of the S&P 500 Index by using box plots.

Analyze the Risk¶
Evaluate the risk profile of each portfolio by using the standard deviation and the beta.

Analyze the Risk-Return Profile
To determine the overall risk of an asset or portfolio, quantitative analysts and investment managers consider not only its risk metrics but also its risk-return profile. After all, if you have two portfolios that each offer a 10% return but one has less risk, you’d probably invest in the smaller-risk portfolio. For this reason, you need to consider the Sharpe ratios for each portfolio.

Diversify the Portfolio
Your analysis is nearing completion. Now, you need to evaluate how the portfolios react relative to the broader market. Based on your analysis so far, choose two portfolios that you’re most likely to recommend as investment options.
